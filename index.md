### Chat with academic papers
Q/A chatbot to interact with academic paper
<br>
- Created a functional chatbot to chat with academic PDF using Langchain framework.
- Loaded document using PDF loaded, split using character text splitter, generated embeddings, persisted in vector store, used LLM-aided conversational retrieval chain and conversation buffer memory.

<br>
- Developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for natural flower classification.
- Implemented deep learning optimization techniques (regularization, optimizers, activation functions, etc.) to enhance accuracy.
- Applied transfer learning (RestNet50, DenseNet201, Xception) and data augmentation methods.
- Experimented with a Kaggle dataset of 100+ flower types.
- Achieved significant improvement in model accuracy, robustness, and generalizability.

### Reinforcement Learning
<br>
[Super Mario Intelligent Agent - Trained using Reinforcement Learning (RL)](/pdf/rl_mario.pdf)
<br>
<img src="images/rl_mario.gif?raw=true"/>
<br>
- There is a lack of work with RL in solving Nintendo Platform games (NES).
- Experimented with Policy Gradient, Deep Double Q-learning (DDQN), and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) in training Super Mario agent.
- Used OpenAI GYM environment, Preprocessed using grey scale observation, resize, skip frame, and frame stack.
- Optimal training was achieved using PPO.
