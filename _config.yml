  I'm Nourin Ahmed, an AI specialist and seasoned software developer. My work in artificial intelligence focuses on machine learning, classification,
  regression, agent-based modeling & simulation, and chatbot development based on LLM. I have published research in the field. Before specializing in AI,
  I accrued four years of experience in software development, building proficiency in Java, Spring, Hibernate, and more.
  I'm driven by the desire to create impactful, user-friendly solutions that improve lives.
  <br><br>
  Throughout my journey, I've earned several academic honors and embarked on an exciting entrepreneurial path, including a victory in a startup pitch competition
  and a place in a competitive startup incubator program. As a self-motivated individual and a mom of a toddler boy juggling multiple responsibilities,
  I'm always open to new opportunities to apply my unique skill set. Reach me at ahmed7k@uwindsor.ca.
